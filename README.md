# How-to-python

This project lays a foundation for the usage and utilities of python. It is like a course that you can go through at your own speed. 
As I create this course, I am solidifying my knowledge about python. I hope that you will be able to learn and apply python after going through this course. 

note: Feel free to still compile the code yourself and check the result, even if a comment with the result it given.

Also: If anything needs more explanation feel free to open an issue, discussion or contact me directly (via the email referenced on my profile). Or contribute directly (see bottom of README).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to clone this repository on your local machine. I will explain how to get set it up in VSCode, any other IDE should be similar.

### Prerequisites

1. **Git** - Make sure you have Git installed on your machine.  
   - [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you haven't already.
2. **Visual Studio Code** - Download and install VSCode if you haven’t yet.  
   - [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

### Cloning the Repository

#### Linux/Windows/macOS

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Either in your explorer/file manager, i.e for linux:

   ```bash
   cd /home/user/my-python-project
   ```

3. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lemonatix/how-to-python.git
   ```
   or with SSH:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Lemonatix/how-to-python.git
   ```
   
sidenote: you copy these links on the <> Code button

### Opening the Project in VSCode

1. **Open VSCode**.
2. **Open Folder**:
   - Go to `File` > `Open Folder...` (on macOS, this will be `File` > `Open...`).
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository, select it, and open it in VS Code.
3. **Open Integrated Terminal** (optional):
   - Go to `View` > `Terminal` to open an integrated terminal in VS Code.
   - The terminal will start in your project’s root directory, where you can run commands like `git status` or any project-specific scripts.

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please follow these steps:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b some-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'adds some features'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin some-name`.
5. Submit a pull request.

Thank you in advance and have fun coding!
