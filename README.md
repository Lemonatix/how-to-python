# How-to-pyton

This project lays a foundation for the usage and utilities of the python programming language. It is like a course that you can go through at your own speed. 
As I create this course, I am solidifying my knowledge about python and hope that you are able to learn the language a bit. 

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to clone this repository on your local machine. I will explain how to get set it up in VSCode, any other IDE shoud be similar though.

### Prerequisites

1. **Git** - Make sure you have Git installed on your machine.  
   - [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you haven't already.
2. **Visual Studio Code** - Download and install VS Code if you haven’t yet.  
   - [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

### Cloning the Repository

#### Linux/Windows/macOS

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Either in your explorer/file manager, i.e for linux:

   ```bash
   cd /home/user/My Python projects
   ```

3. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

4. Navigate into the cloned directory:

   cd repository-name
   ```

### Opening the Project in VS Code

1. **Open VSCode**.
2. **Open Folder**:
   - Go to `File` > `Open Folder...` (on macOS, this will be `File` > `Open...`).
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository, select it, and open it in VS Code.
3. **Open Integrated Terminal** (optional):
   - Go to `View` > `Terminal` to open an integrated terminal in VS Code.
   - The terminal will start in your project’s root directory, where you can run commands like `git status` or any project-specific scripts.
